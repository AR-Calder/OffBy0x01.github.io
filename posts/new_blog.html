<p>Since uni I have had a wix (i know…) based site which hosted old coursework - and was eventually supposed to host blog content. It was easy to setup and easy to customize main content but rather awkward to blog on, and cost quite a lot for what essentially ammounted to static content - in my use case.</p>
<h2 id="why-ssg5">Why SSG5</h2>
<p>Every so often I will have a surge of inspiration to finally get rid of it, to use the latest and greatest static website generators and I’ll spend a few days writing something in gatsby, nextJs, hell - even pure HTML. Ultimately I find a way to over complicate it - which these libraries lend themselves to- usually in an effort to make future blogging easier (ironically), then either get stuck, worn out, or convinced that X library would make this whole thing way easier.</p>
<p>Eventually, my library/framework hopping landed me here - SSG5.</p>
